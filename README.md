Using the BearLibTerminal library, which is pretty excellent so far.

# Design Ideas
Suburban wasteland, possibly post-apocalypse. Takes place in a massive [Fused Grid][0] system. A square will be 4 feet, so a single quandrant will be 325 x 325 squares. That's really big, but we'll see. Procedural quadrants, then filled in with houses and shops and all that jazz, based on Richard Stephens' [Periodic Table of City Planning Elements][2].

Street sizes:

* Local streets are 5 squares wide (20 feet).
* Minor connectors are 10 squares wide (40 feet).
* Major connectors are 13 squares wide (52 feet).
* Freeways are 15-20 squares wide (60-80 feet).

# Development Ideas
Color scheme will be inspired by [Paul Tol's notes][1]. I really like how these colors look, and that they're color-blind friendly.
